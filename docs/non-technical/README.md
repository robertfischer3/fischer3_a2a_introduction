## 🔄 Relationship to Technical Documentation

These non-technical guides **complement** the technical documentation found in `docs/a2a/`:

| Audience | Start Here | Then Read |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Non-Technical** | This folder (`docs/non-technical/`) | Optional: `docs/a2a/00_A2A_OVERVIEW.md` for more detail |
| **Technical** | `docs/a2a/INDEX.md` | Full technical docs |
| **Both** | Start here, then explore technical docs as needed | - |

**Key Difference:**
- **Non-Technical Docs:** Explain concepts, use analogies, focus on "what" and "why"
- **Technical Docs:** Include code examples, implementation details, focus on "how"

---

## 💡 How to Use These Guides

### Reading Tips

**1. Don't Skip the Analogies**
- We use real-world comparisons (coffee shops, business cards, company directories)
- These help build intuition without requiring technical knowledge

**2. Focus on Concepts, Not Details**
- You don't need to memorize technical terms
- Understand the general principles and threat categories

**3. Use the Checklists**
- Security checklist provides actionable assessment criteria
- Share with technical teams for implementation

**4. Ask Questions**
- If something is unclear, that's valuable feedback
- Help us improve these guides for future readers

---
